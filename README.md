# Malware Detection and Management System

## Overview

This is a web-based application for managing malware datasets, visualizing data, and running predictions on malware categories and families. The system includes different user roles: **Admin** and **User**, each with specific privileges. Users can upload datasets, visualize malware data, and run predictions, while admins can manage users, answer questions, and have extended access to dataset functionalities.

## Features

### User Functionality:
- **Login/Registration**: Users can log in using their credentials.
- **Dataset Upload**: Users can upload CSV files with malware data.
- **Data Visualization**: Users can view visualizations of malware categories and families based on their uploaded datasets.
- **Prediction**: Users can run predictions on the latest dataset uploaded.
- **Q&A Section**: Users can submit questions to the admin regarding malware or the system.
  
### Admin Functionality:
- **User Management**: Admins can create, update, and delete users.
- **Answering Questions**: Admins can answer user-submitted questions.
- **Dataset Management**: Admins can upload datasets, run visualizations, and make predictions on any dataset.
- **Extended Visualizations & Predictions**: Admins have access to all visualizations and predictions, including those from user-uploaded datasets.

## Error Handling and Validation
- **Login Errors**: Incorrect username or password returns an error message.
- **Dataset Upload Validation**: Datasets must include the required `category` and `family` columns. Incorrect format will display an error.
- **Prediction/Visualization Failures**: Users cannot run predictions or visualizations if they have not uploaded a valid dataset.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python (Flask Framework)
- **Database**: MongoDB (for storing users, questions, datasets)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for user interface)
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib for generating graphs
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn for making predictions

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/malware-detection-system.git

Here is your text converted to Markdown format:

```markdown
# Navigate to the Project Directory:

```bash
cd malware-detection-system
```

## Set up a Python Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

## Install Required Packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Set Up MongoDB: 
Ensure MongoDB is installed and running. The application will store user, question, and dataset data in MongoDB.

## Start the Flask Application:

```bash
flask run
```

## Access the Application: 
Open your browser and go to [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000).

# Usage

### User Role
1. **Login** using your credentials.
2. **Upload Dataset**: Go to the Upload Dataset section and upload a CSV file.
3. **View Visualizations**: Once the dataset is uploaded, go to Data Visualization to view malware category and family distribution graphs.
4. **Run Predictions**: Visit the Data Prediction section to get predictions on the most and least common malware types.
5. **Q&A Section**: You can ask a question, and the admin will respond to it.

### Admin Role
1. **Login** as an admin user.
2. **Manage Users**: Navigate to the Manage Users section to add, update, or delete users.
3. **Answer Questions**: Respond to user-submitted questions in the Q&A Section.
4. **Upload Datasets**: Upload datasets like a regular user but with access to more detailed functionality.
5. **Visualizations/Predictions**: Access any dataset (including user datasets) to run visualizations or predictions.

# Dataset Requirements

Uploaded datasets must contain the following columns:

- **Category**: Examples include `malware_category`, `mal_cat`, etc.
- **Family**: Examples include `malware_family`, `mal_fam`, etc.

Failure to provide these columns will result in an error.

# Known Issues

- Users must upload a valid dataset before using visualization and prediction features.
- Admins have broader permissions and can bypass certain validations.

---

# Future Enhancements

- Add logging to track user activity and system events.
- Implement notifications for users when their questions are answered.
- Extend support for more complex dataset formats and malware analysis features.
